                            <h1>About</h1>
                            <p>When I was a toddler, I would draw on the walls especially the television screen because I loved the static feel. I always knew I was going to be an artist as that was the main way I expressed myself throughout my life.
                            <br><br>
                            I use visual and digital art to express myself and learn ways how to positively impact my communities as an African and American woman. I strive to use my creative mind to enforce new ideologies that society forces others to not think about. Hopefully, I will continue to change the negative narrative on the African diaspora, Africa as a continent, and other minority communities.
                            <br><br>
                            While focusing on Studio Art and Computer Science at Brandeis University, I will find ways to expand my network, learn about how black creatives navigate the work industry, and practice and learn more about my interests.
